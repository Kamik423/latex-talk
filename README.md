# Du setzt deine LaTeX-Formeln falsch â€“ Normen, Styleguides und Nitpicks

German language talk, supposed to be <30 minutes, when speaking in normal speed more like 45.
The source code is as pretty as I could make it in the time constraints.


## What didn't make it into the talk for time reasons

* Graphics preferrably in TEX > EPS > PDF > PNG > alles-andere
* mod vs bmod
* microtype
* Siunitx ranges and lists
* tikz externalize
* Write one sentence per line
* Other fonts:
    * palatino
    * cochineal / unicodemath(?)
